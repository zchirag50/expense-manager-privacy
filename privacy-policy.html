  <h1>Privacy Policy for Expense Manager</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 16-Nov-2025</p>

  <p>Thank you for choosing <strong>Expense Manager</strong>. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect, how it is used, and the choices you have regarding your data.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>1.1 Financial & Transaction Data</h3>
  <p>The app allows you to create and store financial data such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Expense entries (amount, category, date, notes)</li>
    <li>Income entries</li>
    <li>Budgets and category settings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These entries are stored locally on your device by default.</p>

  <h3>1.2 Usage & Device Data</h3>
  <p>We may collect non-personal usage data to improve the app, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>App version and device model</li>
    <li>Crash reports and performance metrics</li>
    <li>Basic analytics events (if analytics is enabled)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="note">Important — Cloud Sync via Firebase</h3>
  <p><strong>Expense Manager</strong> uses <strong>Firebase</strong> to provide an optional cloud sync feature. If cloud sync is enabled by the user, the app will <strong>automatically sync</strong> the user's expense and budget data to Firebase when the device is online. This ensures your data is backed up and available across devices.</p>
  <p>This automatic sync occurs only when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have enabled the cloud backup / sync option in the app settings, and</li>
    <li>Your device has an active internet connection (online).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>We use data only to provide and improve app functionality, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Syncing data between devices (when cloud sync is enabled)</li>
    <li>Displaying your transactions, balances, and reports</li>
    <li>Diagnosing and fixing crashes or performance issues</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Firebase Services Used</h2>
  <p>When cloud sync or analytics is enabled, the app may use the following Firebase services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Firebase Authentication (optional) — for user accounts</li>
    <li>Cloud Firestore or Realtime Database — to store synced records</li>
    <li>Firebase Crashlytics — for crash reporting</li>
    <li>Firebase Analytics — for anonymous usage statistics (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Firebase is provided by Google. For details on how Google handles data, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cloud data is stored securely using Firebase security practices</li>
    <li>Local data remains on your device unless you enable cloud sync</li>
    <li>We do not sell your personal data to third parties</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Deletion & Account Removal</h2>
  <p>You can delete your local data at any time by clearing the app data or uninstalling the app. If you use cloud sync and want to delete data stored in Firebase, please follow the in-app delete option or contact us and we will remove your cloud data on request.</p>
  <p><strong>To request deletion of cloud data:</strong> email us at <code>your-email@example.com</code> with the subject <code>Delete my Expense Manager data</code>. Include the account email (if any) used for sync so we can locate your records.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Expense Manager is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use third-party services such as Firebase to provide key functionality. These services may collect technical data for performance and reliability — see each provider's privacy policies for details.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated date at the top will reflect any changes.</p>
